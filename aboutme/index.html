    <p>Hi y'all, I am from Spanish Fork, UT. I am a Computer Science Major, Minoring in Electrical Engineering. I have been married to the love of my life, Hannah, for just over a year. We got married after 1 year of dating
         and 7 years of friendship. We are currently living in Rexburg with our little kitty named Misty. Hannah will be graduating in about a year at which time I will go to in-person classes again and work towards my own graduation.</p>
    <p>I am currently employed full-time at Basic American Foods, a potato processing factory, where I work as a supervisor over a line that packages hashbrowns. I have been working there for a year and doing as 
        much school as I can in the mean time. I don't plan to be a potato worker forever, although I'm still not entirely sure what I wanna be when I grow up, I just know that I have a fascination and natural inclination for engineering and computers.
    <p>I was baptized as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ at the age of 8, however I didn't ever go to church before or after that event. It wasn't until I was 13 that my family began to go to church, and even then it was fairly sporadic.
        My parents, three younger brothers, one younger sister, and I were able to be sealed together as a family when I was 16 years old. That experience is what began my personal conversion to Christs restored church. This lead to me serving
        a full-time mission when I turned 18 in the Little Rock Arkansas Mission. My favorite scripture is an indicator of what my sealing to my parents and siblings, as well as my sealing to my wife means to me. </p>
    <p>Helaman 10:7 Behold, I give unto you power, that whatsoever ye shall seal on earth shall be sealed in heaven; and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven; and thus shall ye have power among this people.
