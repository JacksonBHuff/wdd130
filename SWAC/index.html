    <p>Welcome to the official website of Utah County's annual "Shop with a Cop" event! 
        Our goal is to make a difference in the lives of children in need within our community by creating a fun, 
        supportive day that builds positive relationships between young people and law enforcement officers. 
        We try to make it so that every year, in December, generally the first or second Saturday of the month, 
        we can make the children's day, help them feel joy for the holiday season 
        and give them a shopping experience for Christmas they will never forget.
