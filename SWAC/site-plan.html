        Mission Statement: "Making a difference in a child's life"

        Welcome to the official website of Utah County's annual "Shop with a Cop" event! 
        Our goal is to make a difference in the lives of children in need within our community by creating a fun, 
        supportive day that builds positive relationships between young people and law enforcement officers. 
        We try to make it so that every year, in December, generally the first or second Saturday of the month, 
        we can make the children's day, help them feel joy for the holiday season 
        and give them a shopping experience for Christmas they will never forget.

      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>

Why We Do What We Do
The Utah County Shop with a Cop program was founded by Officers, 
Retail Workers and a hand full of Volunteers, on the principles of fostering trust, happiness, 
and a sense of relationship between children and law enforcement officers. 
Many of the families we serve face economic challenges and may have encountered law enforcement 
in less-than-positive situations due to some of those hardships. We believe that by connecting local youth with police officers in a fun,
 caring environment, we can help reshape the way children see law enforcement. 
 Our mission is to foster trust, compassion, and understanding, paving the way for positive community relationships for years to come.

Why Choose Utah County Shop with a Cop?
Shop with a Cop Utah County is not just an event, it is a tradition, a tradition that unites a community and a chance to change lives. Unlike other events, our program is designed to foster meaningful, long-term change by addressing the unique needs of children and families in our area. We’re committed to building a supportive network between the community and law enforcement, and our hands-on, locally focused approach ensures that every dollar and every effort directly benefits children in Utah County.
How the Day Unfolds
The day of the event, parents take their children to  the Spanish Fork Walmart, who is kind enough to allow us to host our event in their store, early in the morning. Every kid is matched with a police officer, and they start their day off riding around the town in police cruisers looking at Christmas lights. This time in the morning is so much fun, the kids are all laughing, and excited and they get to ask the officers questions and they get to know them as a person.

Breakfast
After the tour all of the kids and officers meet at a local school cafeteria for breakfast. It also gives the kids a chance to meet other kids and feel more connected to their officers, making the experience much more friendly and inviting. 

Shopping
Once breakfast is finished, everyone heads to a local Walmart, where each child has the opportunity to shop for holiday gifts. Each child receives a prepaid card loaded with donated funds, giving them the chance to pick out presents for themselves and their loved ones. They get to choose what they want, and it is something that is theirs, and they are proud of. It is a very exciting experience, and it is the true meaning of the holidays.
